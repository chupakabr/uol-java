/**
 * Design a drawing application (have a look at Microsoft Paint application on your Windows system).
 * The application must have menus, and must be able to draw one or more sharps (e. g. point, line,
 * rectangle, oval, etc).
 * The application should use GUI components.
 *
 * Do as much as you can by the deadline, but however submit whatever you have got by the deadline.
 * I donâ€™t expect you to design a complete drawing application, just do as much as you can before the deadline.
 *
 * Hints: The easiest sharps are lines and circles.
 * For lines, you only need decide a starting position and an ending position.
 * For circles, you need to decide the circle center point and its radius.
 * Please try to draw the sharp first then move on to increase the functionality by adding the thickness and
 * color of the sharp, etc.
